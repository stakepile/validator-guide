# Validator setup / Network upgrade guides
A running list of validator setup scripts, playbooks, and network upgrade guides for our team and whoever find them useful. Any scripts written will truly be MVP where the focus will be on automation to save time first. Other automatic checks will be added later as needed.

## Upgrade scripts
If the upgrade is a vanilla upgrade using Cosmovisor with no other custom changes, upgrade scripts can be used to automate upgrade

## Upgrade instructions
If a network upgrade requires configuration changes or state export, it's best to use upgrade instructions and not use the upgrade scripts
