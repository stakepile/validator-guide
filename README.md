# Validator setup / Network upgrade guides
A running list of validator setup scripts, playbooks, and network upgrade guides for our team and whoever find them useful.

## Upgrade scripts
If the upgrade is a vanilla upgrade using Cosmovisor with no other custom changes, upgrade scripts can be used to automate upgrade

## Upgrade instructions
If a network upgrade requires configuration changes or state export, it's best to use upgrade instructions and not use the upgrade scripts
